        Rupareli provides us with a brief overview of what Version Control is,
        and its costs and benefits. He then proceeds to list historically
        popular version-control systems. He first covers open-source version
        control systems, starting with the predecessors to CVS, and finishing
        with git. While Rupareli makes the claim that these free-software VCS
        tools reached a wider audience, he covers a few commercial systems which
        use less-traditional approaches to versioning.

        This paper proposes the modern distributed model for version control. It
        discusses the challenges of maintaining consistency and correctness.
        Underlying mathematical models are briefly defined, and proofs are
        provided where applicable for these models. \textbf{Peer Reviewed.}

        A subjective and brief cost analysis is performed, attempting to show
        that, as it would reduce latency, a DVCS could potentially outperform a
        centralized VCS in real-world situations. The authors develop a small,
        lightweight system to demonstrate this, and discuss their small-scale
        trials. This article provides us with an early look into modern version
        control. \textbf{Peer Reviewed.}
